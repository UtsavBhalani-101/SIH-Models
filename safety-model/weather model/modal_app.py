"""Modal Deployment for Weather Safety Prediction API (Modal v1.1)

This file has been migrated to Modal v1.1 APIs:
- use Image.add_local_dir / add_local_file / add_local_python_source instead of Mount
- set python_version on Image.debian_slim
- keep an ASGI wrapper function to expose the FastAPI app
